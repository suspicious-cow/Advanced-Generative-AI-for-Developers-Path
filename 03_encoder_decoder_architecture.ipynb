    "#### Understanding Input and Target Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by dividing the text into smaller sequences, where each sequence has a fixed number of characters defined by `seq_length`. These sequences are called **input sequences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input sequence, we need a corresponding **target sequence**. The target sequence is just the input sequence shifted by one character to the right. This means the model will learn to predict the next character in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `seq_length` is set to 4 and our text is \"Hello\":\n",
    "- The **input sequence** would be \"Hell\"\n",
    "- The **target sequence** would be \"ello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Add 1 to `seq_length`?\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate both the input and target sequences from the text, we'll actually create sequences of length `seq_length + 1`. This gives us one extra character at the end of each sequence that becomes the target character when the sequence is split.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if `seq_length` is 4:\n",
    "- The sequence generated from \"Hello\" will be \"Hello\" (5 characters).\n",
    "- We'll split this sequence into:\n",
    "  - **Input:** \"Hell\"\n",
    "  - **Target:** \"ello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Converting Text to Character Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can create these sequences, we need to convert our text into numerical data that TensorFlow can work with. Each character in the text will be mapped to a unique integer ID (this mapping is typically based on a predefined vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` function to transform the entire text into a stream of these integer IDs. This function takes a list (or array) of data (in this case, the character indices) and creates a TensorFlow dataset where each element corresponds to a single character's ID.\n",

    "### Compiling the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we are configuring the model for training by compiling it. The `model.compile()` function is where we specify how the model will be optimized during training, and what loss function it will use to measure its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`optimizer=\"adam\"`**:\n",
    "  - **Adam Optimizer**: \n",
    "    - The `Adam` optimizer is a popular choice for training neural networks because it combines the benefits of two other optimizers: AdaGrad (which works well with sparse gradients) and RMSProp (which works well in online and non-stationary settings).\n",
    "    - It is efficient and requires less memory, making it suitable for large datasets and models. Additionally, Adam adapts the learning rate during training, which helps in faster convergence.\n",
    "  - **Default Settings**: \n",
    "    - In this code, we're using the default settings for the Adam optimizer. These default settings include parameters like learning rate, beta1, beta2, and epsilon, which control how the optimizer updates the model's weights during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`loss=loss`**:\n",
    "  - **Loss Function**:\n",
    "    - The `loss` parameter specifies the loss function that will be used to calculate how well the model's predictions match the target values. In this case, the loss function has been defined earlier in the code as `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`.\n",
    "    - **SparseCategoricalCrossentropy**:\n",
    "      - This loss function is typically used for multi-class classification problems where each class is represented by an integer (like in character-level text generation). It computes the cross-entropy loss between the true labels and the predicted labels, but itâ€™s optimized for the case where labels are sparse (i.e., they are integers rather than one-hot encoded vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**:\n",
    "  - Compiling the model is a crucial step because it defines how the model will learn from the data. The optimizer and loss function play a key role in determining the model's ability to converge on a solution that minimizes errors and makes accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility**:\n",
    "  - By choosing Adam and SparseCategoricalCrossentropy, we are ensuring that the model has a robust and flexible training setup that is well-suited for the type of problem we are solving (e.g., text generation, language modeling).\n",
    "\n",
    "This compilation step sets the stage for training the model, where it will iteratively adjust its internal parameters (weights) to minimize the loss and improve its predictions.\n"

    "The above training procedure is simple, but does not give you much control.\n",
    "It uses teacher-forcing which prevents bad predictions from being fed back to the model, so the model never learns to recover from mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that you've seen how to run the model manually next you'll implement the training loop. This gives a starting point if, for example, you want to implement _curriculum  learning_ to help stabilize the model's open-loop output.\n",

    "The most important part of a custom training loop is the train step function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `tf.GradientTape` to track the gradients. You can learn more about this approach by reading the [eager execution guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic procedure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute the model and calculate the loss under a `tf.GradientTape`.\n",
    "2. Calculate the updates and apply them to the model using the optimizer."

The model was trained on a dataset of text to predict the next character in a sequence, and we demonstrated its ability to generate text by simulating a play-like structure. The notebook also provided a custom training loop, model checkpointing, and text generation examples.\n",
